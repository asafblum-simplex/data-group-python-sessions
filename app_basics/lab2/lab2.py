NO GOOGLING ALLOWED FOR THIS LAB
You can consult with each other :)

Try to write the function definitions first; consider the input(parameters and types of each param) and return value
before writing any other code.

For each solution, prefer the most generic implementation

"""
1. 

As a user, i want to input a start number and an end number.
The program should print each number with the following exceptions:
 - For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number.
 - for the multiples of five print "Buzz".
 - For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

Otherwise, print the number
"""

"""
2. 

As a user, i want to be able to get the nth item in a fibonacci sequence by inputting the number i want, and the pair 
of numbers from which to start.
The output should also include the sum-total of all values in the sequence.

Example usage: 
fibo(10, 0, 1) # means, give me the 10th member of the fibo seq, starting from 0 and 1 
fibo(50, 13, 21) # means, give me the 50th member of the fibo seq, starting from 13 and 21

3. (thinking exercise)

After completing the above, think. What did you learn from the implementations? (could be nothing)

Try to articulate it into a few sentences.

4. (research exercise)

FOR THIS QUESTION, GOOGLE (and any other information source) IS ALLOWED

Think about which questions you still have (regarding what we covered thus far, either in sessions or by self-learning).
(If you have questions about more advancded topics than what we have covered, just put them aside for now and we'll get 
back to it soon)
Write down 5 questions that you dont know the answer to (yet).
Try to answer each question on your own the best way that you can.
Write down the explanation in such way that will also be clear to other people.

Repeat the process until you have 5 questions that you are unable to answer on your own.
Partial answers also applies. Which means you will still need to find another question to add to the list.

Send me your list (either privately or in this group).
We will discuss the list you prepared together.
